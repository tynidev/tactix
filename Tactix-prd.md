Create a full-screen HTML page that embeds a YouTube video using the IFrame API.
Overlay the video with an HTML canvas that fills the entire window.
Allow the user to draw freehand lines on the canvas using the mouse.
The lines should appear above the video and be visible in real time.
Use color1 stroke color and a line width of 2px.
The canvas should be transparent and not block the video playback.
Handle resizing of the window so the canvas always matches the viewport.
Make sure the YouTube video autoplays and hides all controls.

Use only vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
No external libraries.

# TACTIX - Team Video Coaching Platform

## Overview

TACTIX is a video-based coaching platform designed for youth sports teams. It allows coaches to upload game footage from YouTube and create interactive coaching sessions with time-synced feedback, drawings, and voice recordings. Players and parents can access personalized coaching points specific to them.

## Key Features

- **Game Video Management** - Upload games via YouTube links, input scores, locations, and game types
- **Interactive Coaching Points** - Create feedback at specific timestamps with:
  - Voice recordings
  - On-screen drawings (arrows, shapes, plays)
  - Player tagging for personalized feedback
  - Labels for categorization (e.g., "defense", "corner kicks")
- **Team Management** - Organize coaches, players, and parents with role-based access
- **Parent Access** - Parents can view coaching feedback specific to their children
- **Recording Sessions** - Coaches can record their entire coaching process, including video controls and drawing sequences, for players to replay later

## Use Case

Perfect for youth sports coaches who want to:
- Provide detailed, visual feedback on game performance
- Save time by recording feedback once for multiple players to review
- Help players improve by letting them see exactly what happened and what to do differently
- Keep parents engaged with their child's development

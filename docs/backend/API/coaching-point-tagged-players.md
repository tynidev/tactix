## Business Logic Details

### Player-Team Relationship
- Players must be members of the team before they can be tagged to coaching points
- Only players belonging to the same team as the coaching point can be tagged
- This ensures coaching feedback is only assigned to relevant team members

### Tag Uniqueness
- Each player can only be tagged once to a specific coaching point
- Attempting to tag the same player twice returns a 409 Conflict error
- Multiple different players can be tagged to the same coaching point

### Permission Validation
- User must be a coach in the team that owns both the coaching point and the player
- Permission is validated through the coaching point's game relationship to the team
- Players from other teams cannot be tagged, even if user has access to multiple teams

### Use Cases
- **Individual Feedback**: Tag specific players who need particular attention
- **Group Feedback**: Tag multiple players involved in a play or situation
- **Position-specific**: Tag players by position for role-specific coaching
- **Performance Reviews**: Tag players for performance evaluation discussions

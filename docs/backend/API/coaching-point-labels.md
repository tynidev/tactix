## Detailed Route Documentation

### POST `/`
Assign a label to a coaching point for categorization.

**Parameters:**
- Body: Label assignment data

**Request Body Schema:**
```json
{
  "point_id": "uuid (required)",
  "label_id": "uuid (required)"
}
```

**Response Schema:**
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "point_id": "uuid",

```

**Authentication/Role Requirements:**

**Business Logic Notes:**
- Verifies user has coach role in the coaching point's game team
- Validates that the label belongs to the same team as the coaching point
- Prevents duplicate label assignments to the same coaching point
- Labels must be created via the Teams API before assignment

**Parameters:**
- Path: `id` (UUID) - Label assignment ID to remove

## Business Logic Details

### Label-Team Relationship
- Labels are created at the team level via the Teams API
- Only labels belonging to the same team as the coaching point can be assigned
- This ensures consistent labeling within team contexts

### Assignment Uniqueness
- Each label can only be assigned once to a specific coaching point
- Attempting to assign the same label twice returns a 409 Conflict error
- Multiple different labels can be assigned to the same coaching point

### Permission Validation
- User must be a coach in the team that owns both the coaching point and the label
- Permission is validated through the coaching point's game relationship to the team
- Labels from other teams cannot be assigned, even if user has access to multiple teams

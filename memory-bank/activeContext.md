# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
Based on the open VSCode tabs and recent file activity, current development work appears to be focused on:

1. **Game Analysis Components** - GameAnalysis.tsx and related functionality
2. **Games Page Development** - GamesPage.tsx and GamesList components
3. **UI Kit Standardization** - ui-kit.css for consistent styling
4. **Authentication System** - Auth components and AuthContext
5. **Team Management** - TeamsGrid and related team functionality

## Recent Changes & Development State
The project shows active development with multiple components open simultaneously, indicating work on interconnected features. Key areas of focus:

### Game Analysis System
- GameAnalysis component appears to be a core feature
- CoachingPointsFlyout component for coaching feedback
- YouTube player integration for video analysis
- Drawing canvas functionality for annotations

### UI System
- Consistent styling through ui-kit.css
- Modal system with confirmation dialogs
- Component organization following established patterns
- Mobile-responsive design considerations

### Team & User Management
- Team creation and management workflows
- User profile systems
- Authentication and authorization flows
- Role-based access control implementation

## Outstanding Issues (from todos.md)
Several key issues remain:

### High Priority
- **Dashboard Statistics**: Games analyzed and sessions statistics are incorrect
- **Auth Session Management**: Sign out doesn't properly invalidate sessions
- **Team Join Functionality**: Need to test joining teams when signing in
- **Team Card Display**: Coaching points count not showing correctly

### Medium Priority
- General team and player management improvements
- Form validation and user experience enhancements

## Next Steps & Decisions

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Fix Dashboard Statistics** - Incorrect data display affects user experience
2. **Resolve Auth Session Issues** - Security concern that needs addressing
3. **Complete Team Join Testing** - Core functionality verification
4. **Team Card Bug Fix** - UI consistency issue

### Development Patterns Observed
- Strong emphasis on TypeScript type safety
- Component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns
- Custom CSS with BEM-like naming conventions
- Hook-based state management for complex interactions
- Consistent error handling and loading states

## Key Implementation Insights

### Video Integration Strategy
The project uses YouTube embedding rather than custom video hosting, which:
- Reduces infrastructure costs
- Simplifies video management
- Requires careful integration with coaching point timestamps
- Needs reliable YouTube Player API implementation

### Drawing System Architecture
- Canvas-based drawing overlay on video
- Event recording for playback functionality
- Toolbar system with collapsible interface
- Touch/mouse input handling for mobile compatibility

### Authentication Flow
- Supabase Auth with JWT tokens
- Row Level Security for data isolation
- Role-based permissions through team memberships
- Guardian-child relationship patterns

## Active Preferences & Standards

### Code Style
- TypeScript throughout the stack
- Component-scoped CSS files
- Index.ts files for clean imports
- Consistent naming conventions

### User Experience Focus
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Keyboard navigation support
- Loading states for async operations
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

### Performance Considerations
- Component lazy loading
- Efficient canvas rendering
- Optimized video player integration
- Minimal re-renders through proper state management

## Learning & Project Evolution
The project demonstrates mature understanding of:
- Modern React patterns and hooks
- Full-stack TypeScript development
- Supabase integration best practices
- Complex UI state management
- Video application development challenges

The codebase shows evidence of iterative improvement and refactoring, with consistent patterns emerging across components and clear architectural decisions being maintained throughout development.

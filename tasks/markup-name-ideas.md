tynidev: What's a good name for a coache's 'markup' or 'annotations' or 'video notes' for a player?

GitHub Copilot: Here are some naming options for a coach's annotations, each with a slightly different connotation:

## Sport-Specific Terms:
- **"Play Review"** - Clear and descriptive, immediately understood
- **"Coach's Take"** - Personal and authoritative
- **"Game Note"** - Simple and familiar
- **"Tactical Note"** - Emphasizes strategy
- **"Film Study"** - Traditional sports terminology
- **"Breakdown"** - Common in sports analysis

## Action-Oriented Terms:
- **"Coaching Point"** - Emphasizes instruction
- **"Feedback"** - Direct and clear
- **"Insight"** - Suggests deeper understanding
- **"Analysis"** - Professional and thorough

## Creative/Branded Terms:
- **"TacNote"** - Short, brandable, combines tactical + note
- **"GameMark"** - Combines game + markup
- **"PlayPoint"** - Alliterative and clear
- **"CoachClip"** - Modern, suggests video segments

## My Recommendation:
I'd go with **"Coaching Point"** for several reasons:
1. Immediately clear what it is
2. Establishes the coach's authority
3. Implies actionable feedback
4. Works well in UI: "You have 3 new coaching points"
5. Can be shortened to "Point" in casual use
6. Scales well: "Team Points" vs "Personal Points"

You could also use it hierarchically:
- **Coaching Point**: The overall annotation/markup
- **Note**: Individual text/audio/drawing within a coaching point

Example usage in UI:
- "Coach Smith added 5 coaching points to yesterday's game"
- "View your personal coaching points"
- "New coaching point at 12:34"

What do you think? Does any of these resonate with your vision for the product?
